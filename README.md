1. Expand the Developer dropodown menu (if needed) and press `Load unpacked` button

## Usage

Lets start off by clicking on the extension icon on top right. <br>

[![Extension Location](./doc/bookmark-popup-location.JPG)]()

<br>

[![Empty Form](./doc/popup-empty-form.png)]()

Here we need to enter a name of the bookmark we wish to create,
and a regular expression based on which our bookmark will be updated <br />

As a demonstration, pictures below will show you how we can use this extension to keep track of the playlist on youtube, and the one that we are going to be using is [Regular Expressions Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6I-Ahc0HB4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9g6m_6Sld9Q4jzqdqHd2HiD) by theNetNinja<br />

[![NetNinja RegExp Tutorial front page](./doc/netNinjaRegExpPlaylistPage.png)]()

<br>

What now? Well what would you do if you wanted to bookmark this page? You would press the star icon <br>

[![star icon](./doc/regularBookmark.png)]()

And the new bookmark would be added pointing to current url with default location of `Other bookmarks` folder.

Same thing is happening here. Once we submit our form a bookmark is gonna be added into `Other bookmarks` folder, except it is gonna be updated whenever we load a new page containing a url matching our regular expression.

But WHAT is a regular expression? Ever looked through page by using CTRL+F? Well regular expression is kinda the same, except it contains special characters which you can find more about by watching playlist that we are already on.
But for now we won't be needing these special characters.

So now that we got that covered, what should our regular expression be?
Well let's have a closer look at the url of the playlist:
<br>

[![playlist url](./doc/playlistUrl.png)]()

The `list=` part of the url is the id of the playlist (it is how youtube knows which playlist we are on). What is so great about this? Well let's try clicking on few videos inside a playlist:

[![playlistVideoOne url](./doc/playlistVideoOne.png)]()
[![playlistVideoTwo url](./doc/playlistVideoTwo.png)]()

Notice how `list=PL4cUxeGkcC9g6m_6Sld9Q4jzqdqHd2HiD` is contained in EVERY video inside a playlist.
Great! That means we can use it.

So what is gonna be our regular expression?

Well it is gonna be `list=PL4cUxeGkcC9g6m_6Sld9Q4jzqdqHd2HiD`, meaning that if a url contains that, then our bookmark will be updated. So let's fill in the form and submit!

Congrats! You have successfully created your first dynamic bookmark!
