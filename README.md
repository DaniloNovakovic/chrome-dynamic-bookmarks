## Introduction

Lets start off by clicking on the extension icon on top right. <br>

![Extension Location](./doc/bookmark-popup-location.JPG)

Upon clicking a button, form with automatically filled input form will be shown. <br />

![Empty Form](./doc/popup-opened-form.PNG)

While *Bookmark name*, and *Url* fields are self explanatory, you might be wondering what does `RegExp` (short for *regular expression*) field represent?

It simply **is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern**. Ever did CTRL+F to find something on page? Well it's prety much the same thing, but with extra special characters that let your search be more flexible.

Once the form is submited a dynamic bookmark will be created inside `Other bookmarks` folder.

![Form Submitted](./doc/formSubmitted.PNG)

Congrats! You have successfully created your first dynamic bookmark!

## Overcoming Custom URL Notation

In most of the cases you won't even have to worry about `RegExp` field since automatically generated value will be good enough, but you might run into rare ocassions where site will be using unique url notation which would require manual entry of this field.

An example of such a site is `animekisa.tv`. Let's see how we can generate regular expression using a very simple tactic.

First, let's **click on few episodes**:

- `https://animekisa.tv/mo-dao-zu-shi-season-2-episode-3`
- `https://animekisa.tv/mo-dao-zu-shi-season-2-episode-4`

Now ask yourself, **what part stays the same?** - `animekisa.tv/mo-dao-zu-shi-season-2`

And that would be our value for the `RegExp` field!

## Bookmark manager

So we created our bookmark, but what if we had alot of bookmarks.
How will we know which ones are tracked / dynamic and which ones arent? What if we wanted to untrack? What if we wanted to maybe change our regural expression? Etc.
For these reasons a new extended bookmark manager which focused on these problems had to be made.

There are two ways we can open it:

- by right clicking on bookmark bar then Bookmark manager
- by navigating to `chrome://bookmarks`

![Bookmark manager page](./doc/managerPage.PNG)

Once you open bookmark manager, on the right, all of the bookmark files will be shown. For easier navigation **dynamic bookmarks** are shown in **red color**.

On the left side (sidenav) you can see two main elements.

![search bar](./doc/searchBar.png)

So let's take a closer look at each...

---

### Search bar

It might look naive, but this search bar is using regular expressions, allowing you to do ALOT of cool stuff.
Here i will just list a few snippets / examples that you can use

- `https` - lists all https links
- `http[^s]` - all http links (without https)
- `http[s]?://w{3}` - http or https links that start with _www_
- `http[s]?://[^w]` - http/https links that DON'T start with _www_
- `http[s]?://.*?\.com/` - http/https links whose domain name ends with _.com_
- `^n` - all bookmarks with bookmark name starting with letter _n_ (or _N_, by default it is not case sensitive)

> To learn more about regular expression watch [theNetNinja tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6I-Ahc0HB4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9g6m_6Sld9Q4jzqdqHd2HiD)

### Folder browser

![Folder browser](./doc/folderBrowser.PNG)

This part should be pretty intuitive. It works exactly like Windows Explorer. **By clicking on arrow or double clicking on folder you open/close it**, and if you click once on a folder you will see its content without toggling it, which is all of the bookmarks that are located inside it (no matter how deep, in my case it will also display children of _WebDesignSites_ folder).

To help guide you visually, folders with **purple** color will contain dynamic / tracked bookmarks which are, as we saw previously filled with **red** color.

Clicking on the folder also selects it, which lets you add/edit/delete it as we will see later, same goes for clicking on bookmark.

> note: you can't edit or delete _Bookmark bar_ and _Other bookmarks_ folders because they are special folders created by chrome

---

### Bookmark information

There are two ways to select bookmark:

1. Clicking on it through sidenav
1. By pressing on right most icon from main section

![displaying bookmark info](./doc/displayingBookmarkInfo.PNG)

Selecting a bookmark will display following:

- _title_ - name of the bookmark
- _url_ - url of page that bookmark is currently pointing to (clickable)
- _parent_ - name of parent folder. (clickable)
- _regExp_ - regular expression (will be hidden if it is not dynamic bookmark)
- _history_ - history of 10 most recent links that bookmark was pointing to (for dynamic bookmarks only)

![bookmark info section](./doc/bookmarkInfoSection.PNG)

### Action buttons

You might have noticed that edit and delete buttons have became available once you clicked on a bookmark. Let's have a look at what they do...

#### Delete button

![Delete button](./doc/deleteButton.PNG)

This one is most straightforward out of them all. **It deletes currently selected element** wheter if it is folder or bookmark. If you cannot delete a folder (_ex. Other bookmarks and Bookmarks bar_) it will be greyed out and you won't be able to click it.

#### Edit button

![Edit button](./doc/editButton.PNG)

There are two different scenarios upon pressing edit button:

- _Folder is selected_ - it will prompt you with a form to change it's name
- _Bookmark is selected_ - it will prompt you with a form to change name, url or regular expression

> **Deleting regular expression will UNTRACK the bookmark!**

#### Add button

To open this one hover over it.

![Add button](./doc/addButton.PNG)

Here you are offered with two options:

1. Add folder (topmost icon)
1. Add bookmark

Both will prompt a modal form for you to fill.

> New bookmark/folder will be created inside currently selected directory.

---

### Changing parent folder

There is one more thing left to cover. By now you may be wondering: _How do i move bookmark/folder?_
Well it's super easy. Simply **click on it, and while holding the left mouse button, drag it over to the parent folder and release.** Thats it! :)

> Reminder: You can't move _Other bookmarks_ and _Bookmarks bar_ because they are special chrome folders which can't be changed

---

## What next

Like i said it would be good to learn regular expressions because knowing it will really let you take full advantage of this extension.

My recommendations are The Coding Train and already mentioned, theNetNinja. You can also use search bar to experiment with regular expressions.

If you have questions which aren't answered in FAQ you can contact me at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danilo-novakovi%C4%87-821934167/) or by (prefferably) posting an issue on github.
Same goes for if you have an additional idea on how to improve this extension.

## FAQ

- **What is *regExp*?**
    - `regExp` (short for regular expression) is a rule upon which it is determined if the URL that you are currently on should be updated. 
    - For example, let's say that your `regExp` was `crunchyroll.com/gintama`. 
    - If you were on a `http://www.crunchyroll.com/gintama/episode-182-screw-popularity-votes-534414`, then that link would match our `regExp` because `crunchyroll.com/gintama` is contained in this URL, and in turn our bookmark would be updated. 
    - But if you were on, let's say, `https://github.com/DaniloNovakovic/chrome-dynamic-bookmarks`, then it would NOT match our `regExp`, hence our bookmark would not be updated.
